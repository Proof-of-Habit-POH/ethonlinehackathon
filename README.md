# Proof of Habit
Developed for ETHOnline 2024

Proof of Habit addresses the universal challenge of habit formation by combining behavioral economics, social psychology, and blockchain technology. By creating a system where users have "skin in the game" and can receive support from their community, we increase the likelihood of successful habit adoption.

Our use of AI for verification adds a layer of accountability while maintaining user privacy and reducing the need for manual checks. The integration with blockchain technology ensures that all transactions and commitments are transparent and tamper-proof.

## Introduction

Proof of Habit is an innovative blockchain-based application designed to help individuals build and maintain positive habits through a unique incentive system. Our application leverages the power of smart contracts, social accountability, and artificial intelligence to create a robust habit-forming ecosystem.

### Key Features:

</p>

1. **Blockchain-Backed Commitments**: Users create habit pledges on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability of their commitments.

2. **Financial Incentives**: Participants stake cryptocurrency as a self-imposed penalty for failing to meet their habit goals, creating a powerful motivator for success.

3. **Social Sponsorship**: Friends and supporters can sponsor a user's habit journey, adding additional rewards and encouragement.

4. **AI-Powered Verification**: Daily progress is verified using ChatGPT-4o, which analyzes photo evidence submitted by users to confirm habit completion.

### Technology Stack:

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity, Foundry
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Ethers.js
- **Authentication**: Sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE) by WalletConnect
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: Prisma
- **Verification AI**: ChatGPT-4o

2. **Create Your Habit Challenge**:
   - Define the habit you want to build
   - Set the duration (number of days)
   - Choose your stake amount (penalty for failure)

3. **Invite Sponsors**: Share a unique link with friends to sponsor your habit journey.

4. **Daily Verification**:

By combining financial incentives, social support, and AI verification, Proof of Habit creates a powerful ecosystem for personal growth and habit formation.
